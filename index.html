            These stunning caves aren’t part of some fairy-tale world or horror
            movie – they can be found in some of the world’s most remote places
            in Asia, North America, and Europe. Some of these caves form when
            water seeps down through cracks in limestone rock. The limestone
            rock dissolves into the water bit by bit, forming cracks and
            openings. Over millions of years, these openings, and the limestone
            left behind by dripping water can make the majestic cave formations
            you see here.Other types of caves were formed over millions of years
            by being gradually worn away by the lake or seawater.If you’re
            thinking of rushing off to visit one of these famous caves, hold
            your horses. Although some of the caves are open for public, like
            Phraya Nakhon Cave in Thailand, the majority of them are only open
            to extreme adventurers who have to get their passes in advance. As
            you can see from the pictures below, the people who get the chance
            to explore these beautiful nature specimens are equipped with some
            special equipment. Fortunately for us, almost all expeditions to the
            caves are joined by professional photographers. Their precious photo
            shoots allow us to learn about those mysterious places on Earth that
            are still untouched by humankind.

            visit. We strongly recommend booking your tickets in advance,
            especially for busy periods such as weekends and school holidays. We
            also recommend bringing headphones for our audio guides, as well as
            comfortable shoes. Please note, there are no toilets on site. You
            are welcome to use the facilities at our partner attraction, the
            National Justice Museum, around 5 minutes' walk away. The City of
            Caves is cashless. Need to pay cash? You can book tickets for the
